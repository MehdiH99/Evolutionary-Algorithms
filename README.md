N-Queen Problem Solutions

This repository contains implementations of the N-Queen problem using four different optimization algorithms: Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Bees Algorithm, and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). The N-Queen problem is a classic combinatorial problem that involves placing N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

Introduction

The N-Queen problem is a well-known problem in computer science and artificial intelligence. Each of the algorithms implemented in this project uses a different approach to find a solution to the problem. The goal is to demonstrate the effectiveness of these optimization techniques in solving combinatorial problems.

Algorithms Implemented

Genetic Algorithm (GA)
An evolutionary algorithm that uses selection, crossover, and mutation to evolve solutions to the N-Queen problem.

Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)
A population-based optimization technique inspired by the social behavior of birds and fish, where solutions move through the search space influenced by their own and neighbors' experiences.

Bees Algorithm
A foraging behavior-inspired optimization technique that mimics the search behavior of bees to find optimal solutions.

Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
An optimization algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, utilizing pheromone trails to find optimal paths to solutions.
